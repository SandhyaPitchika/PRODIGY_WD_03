## Instructions
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns to mark a square with their symbol (X or O).
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
If all 9 squares are filled and no player has achieved a row of three, the game is a draw.

The game will automatically switch turns between Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).
